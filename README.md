# Medical Services App

A simple web application to book and manage medical service requests. It includes user and admin roles, service booking, request management, and authentication.

## üöÄ Tech Stack Used
- **Frontend:** React (Vite), React Router, Axios, CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, JWT Authentication, Bcrypt.js
- **Database:** JSON file (local storage for prototype)
- **Others:** CORS, Body-Parser, UUID for unique IDs

---

## üìå Assumptions Made
- Users can register as either **user** or **admin**.
- Only **admins** can accept, complete, or delete service requests.
- Data is stored in a `data.json` file instead of a real database (for prototype simplicity).
- JWT tokens are used for authentication and stored in browser `localStorage`.
